    "Here, we describe how we calculate the expected number of PS counts, given the model parameters.  These computations are implemented in the file `get_counts_inline.pyx` in the `likelihood/` subfolder.  First, we describe the computation for a general PS population, with density function $\\rho(s,\\ell,b)$, where $(s,\\ell,b)$ are spatial coordinates with origin at the Earth, and luminosity function $dN/dL$.  Note that $\\ell$ and $b$ are Galactic longitude and latitude, respectively, while $s$ is the distance from the Earth.  The expected number of counts in a given spatial bin (labeled by $i,j$) and flux bin (labelled by $k$) is given by the integral\n",
